# Lemon Counting Project

This repository contains code and resources for a lemon counting project that leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to detect and count lemons in real-time or from stored images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and accurate system to count lemons in images or video feeds. The system can be useful in agricultural applications, supply chain management, or any setting where automated counting of produce is needed.

## Features

- **Real-time Lemon Detection and Counting**: Processes images or video feeds to identify and count lemons.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applies techniques such as resizing, color adjustments, and noise reduction for better detection accuracy.
- **Model Prediction**: Uses a trained model to detect lemons and output the count.
- **Modular Code**: Organized with modular functions for flexibility and easy customization.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
